#Demo

Programming language I started with: Fortran
This was in my 200L in University.
Then I learnt python and still learning python.
I forsee that up next is JavaScript.


So the journey started.
We can know how we start but its only when we end we will know how it ended.

Make mistakes, get corrected.
Hit a wall, grope for the door.
Fall in a hole, find a way to climb up back.
Followed a wrong path, retrace your steps.
